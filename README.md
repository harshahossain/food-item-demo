## Assesment Task: 1
Firstly, I will pull request from the main branch. Name my branch as 'Hotfix-*the problem which is being solved*'. After solving the problem I will have to push it to my branch then pull request on the main branch for somebody with higher access to merge it. But If I'm merging it, I will see if there's any conflict. If there's no conflict I wil merge it with the main branch. 

## Assesment Task: 2
Firstly, I will go through each object in the array via a loop while conditioning the category. As the condition matches like where *id==given id* I will put them on a new array and output that new array like *return result*
